When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with more people on the same project.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For more control, because other people might be making changes that you don't want to get yet?
Although for that they should be working in another branch...
